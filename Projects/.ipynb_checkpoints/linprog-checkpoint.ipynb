    "## Introduction\n",
    "The package I gonna use is `scipy.optimize.linprog`, which is a subpackage of `scipy.optimize`. It is designed to solve the linear programing problem using the so called `Simplex` method. I learned this method also in MATH 340 last semester and I thought it is a interesting topic and sufficient way to solve it with computer (we can solve it by hand but just with small amount of variables). We used software called `Lindo` to deal with the problem when it came to a large amount of variables and statistic analysis. So this time, I will try use Python to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Linear Programming` might best be called `Linear Optimization`: it means finding maxima and minima of linear functions of several variables subject to constraints that are linear equations or linear inequalities. The word “programming” has the old-fashioned meaning of “planning” and was chosen in the forties, before the advent of computers.\n",

Actually I tried to find some firms' annual report to see whether they properly allocate their resources to maximize the profit, but it seems most resources are classified and I cannot give the whole linear system."

    "### Standard Form of a Linear Program\n",
    "   [Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is a **linear optimization** technique which is used to find maxima and minima of linear functions of several variables subject to constraints that are linear inequalities or linear equations. This optimization method is powerful in modeling a variety of problems in scheduling and design, and in fact the word \"programming\" itself has the old-fashioned meaning of \"planning\". It is widely used in economics, business and many other industries in areas such as manufacturing, game theory, nutrition balancing and  stock cutting.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   A linear program (LP) is typically expressed in a fixed format called the **standard form**, which looks like:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$ \\mathrm{Maximize} \\ \\ c_1x_1+c_2x_2+\\dots+c_nx_n$$\n",
    "   $$ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{subject \\ to} \\ \\ a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\\dots+a_{1n}x_n \\leq b_1$$\n",

    "   \n",
    "   We can also rewrite the LP in [canonical form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_form) by setting: \n",

    "### Characteristics of standard form LPs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 1**: The standard form LP is about **maximizing**, not minimizing \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 2**: There is a positivity constraint for each variable ($x_i \\geq 0$ for all $i$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule 3**: The other constraints are all of the form \"linear combination of variables $\\leq$ constant\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting a LP to its standard form \n",
    "We can convert any LP into its equivalent LP in standard form, or the other way around. There are many \"errors\" that you need to fix such as a variable lacks a positivity constraint (violates **Rule 2**) or a constraint is an equality (violates **Rule 3**). However, those \"errors\" are unrelated to this project so we are not going to introduce them here. You can read this [documentation](http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu/classes/QUANT/NOTES/chap7/node3.html) for more information about conversion on your own. Here, we just need to know several conversion rules before we can begin using `scipy.optimize.linprog`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The objective function is to be minimized**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a violation to **Rule 1** and it is easy to change. Minimizing $c_1x_1+c_2x_2+\\dots+c_nx_n$ is the \"same\" as maximizing $-c_1x_1-c_2x_2-\\dots-c_nx_n$. The maximum value of the new objective function is just **minus** the minimum value of the old objective function, and the values of the other variables that lead to the optimum stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Constraints are lower bound**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a violation to **Rule 3** and it is also easy to fix. We just need to replace $a_{i1}x_1+a_{i2}x_2+\\dots+a_{in}x_n \\geq b_i$ with $-a_{i1}x_1-a_{i2}x_2-\\dots-a_{in}x_n \\leq -b_i$. Notice that this does not change the values of $x_j$ that satisfy the constraints.\n",

    "### `scipy.optimize.linprog`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `linprog` **minimizes** a linear objective function subject to constraints that are either linear equations or linear inequalities. It is intended to be used to solve linear programs in the form of: \n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{Minimize} \\ \\textbf{c}^\\mathrm{T}\\textbf{x}$$\n",
    "$$ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\mathrm{subject \\ to} \\ A_{ub} \\textbf{x} \\leq \\mathbf{b_{eq}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this form doesn't include any positivity constraints for **x**  (so no Rule 2), and this is a special feature of `linprog` where the bounds on **x** can be set explicitly. As you can see, `linprog` is used to solve problems that **deviate from** the standard LP problems because it is about **minimizing**, not maximizing. The first parameter of `linprog` is the vector **c**, which represents the coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized. All the other inputs are optional. However typically to solve an LP, we also need the second input $\\mathbf{A_{ub}}$ which is a 2-D array that is matrix-multiplied by **x** to give values of the **upper-bound** inequality constraints. This follows the standard LP problem assumption that the constraints are all of the form \"linear combination of variables $\\leq$ constant\" (so Rule 3 is satisfied). Also, we need the third input $\\mathbf{b_{eq}}$ which is a 1-D array that represents the values on the right hand side of the constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we don't need to make any changes to the parameter 'bounds' since the default follows from the standard form LPs. The assumption that all variables must be non-negative is satisfied here (so Rule 2 is satisfied). However, the function `linprog` can also give non-standard bounds to the variables **x**. In that case, the bounds of the variables need to be set explicitly. You can check out the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.18.1/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html#scipy.optimize.linprog) to learn more about the parameters of `linprog`.\n",

    "   The [root-finding problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm) is one of the most essential computational problems that has many practical applications in biochemistry, engineering, business, physics, etc. The root-finding problem is the problem of finding a root of the equation  $f(x)=0$, where $f(x)$ is a function of a single variable x. Specifically, it is stated in mathematics as: given a function $f(x)$, find a number $x=\\epsilon$ such that $$f(\\epsilon)=0$$ \n",
    "   \n",
    "The number $x=\\epsilon$ is called a **zero** of the function $f(x)$ or a **root** of the equation $f(x)=0$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Also note that [equation solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving) is equivalent to finding **roots/zeros** of a function. If we are trying to solving the equation $f(x)=g(x)$, where x is the unknown in the equation, we can take the equation to its canonical form $f(x)-g(x)=0$ and then find the roots. "

    "The function `scipy.optimize.fsolve` is used to find the roots of a given function $f(x)=0$. It returns the roots of the function defined by $f(x)=0$ given a **starting estimate**. This requires us to change the equation into its canonical form before we begin on using the function. This function `fsolve` takes on two required inputs and the rest is optimal. The first input is **func**, which is a scalar function that takes at least one argument. Thus, we always need to define our function that is already in the standard form. The second output is important. It is $\\mathbf{x_0}$, which is the **starting estimate** for each root of $f(x)=0$. We need to guess the approximate location of the roots. You can check out the [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html#scipy.optimize.fsolve) on `scipy.optimize.fsolve` for more information on parameters. \n",

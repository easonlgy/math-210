    "### `scipy.optimize.linprog`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `linprog` **minimizes** a linear objective function ${\\hspace 2mm}z \\leq \\bar{c}^{\\intercal}{\\hspace 0mm}x{\\hspace 2mm}$subject to both linear equality and inequality constraints ${\\hspace 2mm}\\boldsymbol{A}{\\hspace 0.5mm}x \\leq \\bar{\\boldsymbol{b}}{\\hspace 2mm}$. It takes at least an array-like input `c` which represents the coefficients of the linear objective function $z$. This parameter is the only *required* input of `linprog` since an L.P. problem can have an objective function with no constraints at all. The array-like inputs are of types such as list or array.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there a few important optional inputs that `linprog` can take. It notably distinguishes a linear constraint with equality $\\{{\\hspace 0.25mm}={\\hspace 0.25mm}\\}$ or inequality $\\{{\\hspace 0.25mm}\\leq{\\hspace 0.25mm},{\\hspace 0.25mm}\\geq{\\hspace 0.25mm}\\}$. The inputs `A_ub` and `b_ub` take elements of the matrix $A$ and vector $b$ correspondingly to the rows of **inequality**${\\hspace 2mm}\\boldsymbol{A}{\\hspace 0.5mm}x \\leq \\bar{\\boldsymbol{b}}{\\hspace 2mm}$. Meanwhile, the inputs `A_eq` and `b_eq` take elements of the matrix $A$ and vector $b$ correspondingly to the rows of **equality**${\\hspace 2mm}\\boldsymbol{A}{\\hspace 0.5mm}x = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{b}}{\\hspace 2mm}$. Hence, the linear programming problem do not necessarily have to be in standard form for `linprog` to solve it. However, it is highly important to note that `linprog` only accepts the above optional inputs if the lengths of `b_ub` and `b_eq` are equal to the rows of `A_ub` and `A_eq` and the columns of `A_ub` and `A_eq` are equal to the length of `c` respectively. Otherwise, it will give an `error` message. For references of this row and column parity, go back to the L.P. model that has been defined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important optional input `linprog` can take is `bounds`. It is the pair `(min,max)` that defines the range of values that each element in $x$ can be defined. By default, `bounds` are `(0,None)` - i.e. the positivity constraint $\\forall{x}\\geq{0}$. Meanwhile, the rest of the optional inputs are trivial to the end process of reaching optimality, but more information is provided in the function's [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html): `scipy.optimize.linprog?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the output of the `linprog` function returns 7 specific entries:\n",
    "* $fun$ ${\\hspace 10mm}$$\\rightarrow$ the value of the objective function\n",
    "* $message$${\\hspace 2.5mm}$$\\rightarrow$ the text information about the status of the optimization respective of the `integer` of $status$ described below\n",
    "* $nit$ ${\\hspace 11.775mm}$$\\rightarrow$ the number of iterations performed \n",
    "* $slack$${\\hspace 8.35mm}$$\\rightarrow$ the values of the slack variables at optimality \n",
    "* $status$${\\hspace 7.1mm}$$\\rightarrow$ an integer from the list `[ 0, 1, 2, 3 ]`; please see [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html) to go in full details as to what they represent\n",
    "* $success$${\\hspace 4.55mm}$$\\rightarrow$ True/False whether optimality was reached\n",
    "* $x$${\\hspace 16mm}$$\\rightarrow$ the optimal solution"

    "Perfect! They are almost identical and as you can see our very own defined function `lp` is even more specific about the optimality as it tells you that there are more than one optimal solution since `t` can vary within a bounded region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are at the end of this notebook you should be able to solve feasible linear programming problems with the `scipy.optimize.linprog` function with no trouble at all. Evidently, we have gone through a very common error in using this function - that is forgetting to convert it to a minimization problem with upper bounds or equality constraints and, most importantly, $-c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a side note, even though this notebook did not cover any *infeasible* linear programming problems, those types of L.P. problems are quite easily solved with the `linprog` function when a [special pivot to feasibility](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Infeasible.htm) has been performed to it. If interested, you can watch the video below at full length for a thorough demonstration in doing so. Please take note that the concept in the video is explained in [tableau form](https://www.utdallas.edu/~scniu/OPRE-6201/documents/LP06-Simplex-Tableau.pdf), which is an alternative to a [dictionary form](http://cis.poly.edu/POG/canon.pdf) - that of the latter is the format of the algorithm in this notebook. However, they have the same information and the techniques used to find optimality are of no differences."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "[Linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. The feasible region(points that satisfy the contrainsts) is [a convex polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polytope), which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Here is a pictorial representation of a simple linear program with two variables and six inequalities:![LP](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Linear_optimization_in_a_2-dimensional_polytope.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The yellow part is the feasible region, black lines are constraints, the red line is the level set of the objective funtion and the arrow denotes the direction in which we are optimizing.\n",

    "Linear programming can be applied to [various fields of study](http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/linear-programming/applications-of-linear-programming-for-solving-business-problems-economics-2/28946/). It is widely used in business and economics, and is also utilized for some engineering problems.

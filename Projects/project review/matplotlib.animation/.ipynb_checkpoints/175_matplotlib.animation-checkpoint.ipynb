    "\n",
    "[Animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation) has been around in various forms for a long time. [Computer animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation) has become quite commonplace in movies and other entertainment mediums, and it can also be a useful tool in explaining ideas or demonstrating concepts from many fields. For example, the [Reimann Sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) central to integral calculus may be visualized more easily when animated. In addition, the presentation of animated data and results can be more engaging for an audience than static images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, learning how to animate well can be a lengthly affair. However, simple animations are not overly difficult to achieve without a deep technical understanding and may later serve as a useful foundation when learning more advanced techniques. With simplicity in mind, the focus of this notebook will be to introduce the `animation` module of the `matplotlib` Python plotting library for use in a Juypter Notebook. "

    "\n",
    "This project aims to show how one can create simple animations with the `animation` module of the `matplotlib` plotting library in a Juypter Notebook. This goal is approached in three parts, the first of which is quickly setting up the Jupyter Notebook to display embedded animations. The second part will be a detailed tutorial for the `FuncAnimation` class of animation in the `animation` module. This tutorial will explain the essential input parameters required as well as how to save an animated file. Finally, the third part consists of several examples which will highlight how the essential parameters of `FuncAnimation` can vary depending on what the end goal of the desired animation is."

    "\n",
    "From our simple starting animation of the sine wave, the parameters of `FuncAnimation` were introduced. We have seen how those parameters can be modfied to accomdate different animations. Furthermore, in the *beat* example, we can see how animation can be very helpful in demonstrating the concept of interference. But there is many more applications to the `FuncAnimation` than we have explored, see [these examples](http://matplotlib.org/2.0.0/examples/animation/index.html) for some additional examples. Hopefully this tutorial will serve as a good starting point for further animation adventures."
